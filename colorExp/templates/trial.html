        <p>In this experiment, you will make judgments about compressed images. On each trial, you will see four images.</p>
        <p>The image on the left is the <b>original image</b>. The three images on the right are the <b>compressed images</b>. Your task is to <b>rank the compressed images</b> based on how well they resemble the original image. To rank the compressed images, <b>click and drag</b> the best image to the top and the worst image to the bottom. If you feel two images are tied, do not worry about their ranking.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this experiment is to determine if providing additional visual information (which we refer to as <em>decisional support</em>) can be used to improve an individual’s ability to categorize images.  In this experiment, the type of decisional support was varied in order to understand what factors are important for accurate performance. For example, if additional information is presented in the form of example images from a category, it is important that the example images be selected carefully. For instance, images could be selected in a way that takes into account how humans perceive similarity between objects. Your data will help us determine the factors—such as the method of image selection—that impact categorization performance. Our hypothesis is that decisional support can improve categorization performance.</p>
