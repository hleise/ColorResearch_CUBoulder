                <li>Your questions, concerns, or complaints are not being
                    answered by the research team.

            <p>The purpose of this research is to determine what factors
                most affect an individual's decisions. Knowledge gained from
                this research could lead to a better understanding of human
                cognition as well as improved methods for web design.</p>
            <h3>What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You will be using your own computer to complete the
                    study at a time of your choosing.
                </li>
                <li>You will complete a series of visual tasks (i.e.,
                    trials) that will take a total of 15 minutes on average.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>On each trial, you will see a shape and two names.</li>
                    <li>Your task will be to select the name you think
                        best matches the given shape.
                    </li>
                    <li>You should do this as quickly and accurately as you
                        can.

                </ul>

                    of the study.
                </li>
                <li>We will only record your behavior on each trial (e.g.,
                    example selected, response time) and your worker ID. No
                    personally identifiable information will be collected.

            <h3>What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?</h3>
            <p>You can leave the research at any time and it will not be
                held against you. If you choose to leave during the
                experiment, any data collected will be permanently deleted.</p>

                National Science Foundation may inspect and copy this
                information.</p>
            <p>All data collected will be stored on a secure server
                indefinitely and will only be accessible by the research

                of your time and effort. This amount will not be pro-rated
                for partial/incomplete participation.</p>
            <p>If you wish to learn more about the results of this
